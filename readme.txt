A word counter written in Python. Windows only.

Features:
 - tracks your word count no matter where you type
 - boosts your self esteem
Never feel unproductive again! With this word counter, you may forever bask in the glory of your productivity.

To run:
 - download WordCounter.py or WordCounter.exe
 - place in a directory with a folder called "assets"
    - note: assets must contain at least one gif, jpg, or png
 - run the program!

How to use:
 - arrow buttons switch the count mode (currently available: word count, character count, and character count with spaces)
 - star button allows you to shuffle through the images in your assets folder
 - pause button temporarily stops the word counter from tracking you; press again to resume counting
 - mini button removes the image and star buttons; press again to view them again
 - hit shift + esc to enter move mode
    - use arrow keys to move the program around in move mode
    - hit esc once to exit move mode
    - you will not be able to shuffle images while moving the program; this is intentional
    - still usable when program is paused
 - hit esc twice to exit the program
    - still usable when program is paused

About assets:
 - program does not run if you don't have an assets folder or if the folder has no pictures :(
 - beyond that, put whatever you want in there
 - works best with square images that are 100-300px large
 - default assets are fanmade icons from the ember knight
